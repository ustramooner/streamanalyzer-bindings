This project is an extensive set of bindings around Strigi's
Streams and StreamAnalyzer libraries (http://strigi.sourceforge.net/). 
This project contains generic swig .i files which are used by all languages.

At this stage, there is currently only one language implementation,
but the intention is that more language bindings can easily be 
created.

Instructions on checking out strigi-bindings with git:

 git clone git://github.com/ustramooner/streamanalyzer-bindings.git

 cd streamanalyzer-bindings

 git submodule update --init

Please see documentation, issues, etc in each subproject:
